_You are reading this book for two reasons. First, you are a programmer. Second, you want to be a better programmer.
Good. We need better programmers._.

## Publisher

There are many publishers of programming books, so are good, and some unfortunately are uncomfortable to read. I want to
suggest some that I think are great.

### O'Reilly

O'Reilly books are a source of reliable knowledge, given in a simple and accessible way. The books are characterized not
only by a very high level of content, but also clarity and comprehensiveness. They have gained recognition of computer '
gurus' and are honored with many prestigious awards. They are a kind of compendium of knowledge, useful not only for
programmers and administrators but also for all software and hardware users.

#### Kontrola wersji z systemem Git

<sup>Author:  *"O'Reilly"* </sup>

The only book about *version control* that I have read. It's so well written that as a reader I did not need to
supplement knowledge from other sources.

From the book you learn:

- What the history of version control systems was like
- How to install Git
- How a version control system works with Git
- How to manage file version control using git commands.

#### Nowoczesne receptury w Javie

<sup>Author:  *"O'Reilly"* </sup>

The introduction of functional programming elements, such as lambda expressions, method references and streams,
completely changed the working technique.

From the book you learn:

- Basic concepts of functional programming.
- Sorting data streams.
- Laziness, deferred execution and composition of closures.
- Mapping and flat mapping.
- Functional programming and working with files and directories.
- Java 9 capabilities, including Jigsaw, private interface methods, collectors, date streams.

#### Docker. Praktyczne zastosowania

<sup>Author:  *"O'Reilly"* </sup>

From the book you learn:

- A good introduction to Docker.
- How to debugging Docker images and containers.
- Efficient deployment of applications in production environments
- How to deploy containers in public and private clouds

#### Ciągłe dostarczanie oprogramowania w języku Java

<sup>Author:  *"O'Reilly"* </sup>

This book is a practical guide to help Java developers master the techniques needed to successfully apply the continuous
delivery method. It describes the best principles for building software architecture, automatic quality control,
packaging applications, and deploying them in various production environments. Special attention is paid to software
testing: a range of testing methodologies are presented, their use and importance in the application lifecycle is
described. An interesting element of the book is the information about bad practices and anti-patterns, along with tips
for solving such problems.

From the book you learn:

- a solid foundation for continuous software delivery
- Migrating to continuous software delivery Tools: Jenkins, PMD and FindSecBugs
- principles of functional and software quality testing
- techniques for observing applications in a production environment

### Others

#### Java. Podstawy. Wydanie X

<sup>Author:  *"Cay S. Horstmann"* </sup>

Reading this book allows you to delve thoroughly into the Java core library.

In my opinion, this book is too extensive and written in a language that is too technical, but this cannot be seen as a
drawback. It discusses all elements of the language and object-oriented programming.

As I write this post, the book has reached **Edition XI**, which includes advanced techniques such as lambda
expressions. In **Edition X** these are contained in a separate book.

#### Czysty kod

<sup>Author:  *"Martin Robert C."* </sup>

- How to write good code and turn bad code into good code?
- How to format code for maximum readability?
- How to implement full error handling without cluttering the code logic?
